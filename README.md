# Project Name

## My Task (Technical Test)

## Overview

This repository contains two main folders: `frontend` and `backend`. The `frontend` is built using Vite and React, while the `backend` is built using Express.js.

## Folder Structure

- `frontend`: Contains the frontend codebase built with Vite and React.
- `backend`: Contains the backend codebase built with Express.js.

## Environment Variables

Both the `frontend` and `backend` folders have their own `.env` files. You can copy the respective `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file in each folder and configure the necessary environment variables.

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   yarn install
   cp .env.example .env
   yarn dev

### Backend 

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   npm run dev
